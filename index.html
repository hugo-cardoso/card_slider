                What it lacks in power and refinement it makes up for in character and likability. The Abarth 500 is an reverse-engineered VW Bug designed by Italians for Italians. But you don’t have to be from Italy to appreciate its glorious sound and adorable form. The Cinquecento is an acquired taste but, like most good things, once you have acquired a taste for them they become a part of you.s

              <p>
                Carlo Abarth is rightfully famous for applying the dark art of tuning to some of the most unlikely cars in the world—simple, robust, but decidedly unsporting Fiats—and creating legitimate giant-slaying racers out of them. This Abarth 131 is a homologation version of the standard Fiat 131, a relatively tame family sedan until fitted with a 2-liter, 16-valve fuel-injected motor creating nearly 140 horsepower. Combined with lightweight fiberglass body panels sporting box flares and aggressive air scoops, the boxy coupe can scoot to 60 in less than eight seconds—incredible performance for such a small car developed during the 1970s. With independent rear suspension fitted by Abarth, the 131 is perfectly suited for hanging out its duck-tailed hindquarters on the tight, technical courses. This road version allowed the 230 horsepower rally version to dominate World Rally Championship racing between 1977 and 1980. With only 400 of the street cars ever produced, Forza is probably the best place to experience this diminutive Italian rally car on the road.

              <p>
                Equal parts cute Italian runabout and hard-charging smile generator, the Fiat Abarth 500 esseesse packs a lot of charisma into such a small package. However, one peek at the twin tailpipes peeking out from beneath the rear valance, or the athletic hatch-mounted spoiler, will tell you that this diminutive Italian is pumped up with go-fast bits. The 1.4-liter four makes enough turbocharged ponies to sling the Abarth from apex to apex without breaking a sweat. Not that the handling’s been ignored; technical courses will demonstrate the Abarth’s remarkable sure-footedness, derived from a lower ride height and cockpit-adjustable sport suspension. As balanced (and fun) as the Abarth 500 is right out of the box, Fiat is a blank slate and the Upgrade Shop begs the question: can you build a better hot hatch?

              <p>
                In case you don’t speak Italian, “Biposto” means two-seater. In terms of this micro-sized hot hatch, two-seater means more fun than might be legal. That’s why Abarth – pronounced ‘Ah-Bart’ – calls the 695 Biposto an entry-level track day car. Celebrating 50 years since the introduction of the immensely popular Abarth 695, the Biposto comes with features than make it a screaming fast pocket rocket with handling that rivals sports cars twice its price. All the upgrades come from the most preferred brands in performance including: Akrapovic exhaust, Brembo brakes, OZ wheels, Garrett turbo, and more. These components and the tuning result in a car that is far from its diminutive daily driving cousins with a backseat and a thrilling driving experience that is anything but small.
